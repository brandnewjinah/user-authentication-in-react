Creating a registration and login form may sound simple and easy, but it requires intricate details. I think a good understanding of this process can not only lead to good utilization of forms but also good understanding of how http and server communications work throughout many other React projects. This is why I wanted to take time to study forms and authentication by creating a few different types of login and registration forms.

**This is going to be my process**

1. Build a simple registration and login form in React
2. Build a simple registration and login form in React Native
3. Build a registration and login form in React based on best practices
4. Build a registration and login form in React Native based on best practices

**I'm going to focus on**

- Using hooks
- Building a simple form without using any library
- Building other forms with popular libraries such as Joi, Yup and Formik Chances are I have to work with someone else's code that's already been built with popular libraries. So it's important for me to understand how they work
- How basic HTTP communications work
